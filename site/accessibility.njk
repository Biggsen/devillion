                <p>We often think about users with a disability as needing assistance to access websites, but there are common problems that can prevent many people from being able to use your website including:</p>

                <ul class="mb-12 list-disc pl-10">
                    <li>users needing a mouse to move around the website</li>
                    <li>users not being able to see part of the website on their mobile phone</li>
                    <li>users not being able to read the text because of the colour of the background</li>
                    <li>screen readers unable to access content</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We can <a href="/services#accessibility-review">help you identify</a> where people may struggle with your website and <a href="/services#front-end-development">fix any problems</a> to make your website accessible. Sometimes it can be as simple as changing the font or the background colour to make it easier to read.</p>

                <p>Your website could be missing elements that mean users cannot navigate between sections and headings, complete a contact form or click on a telephone number to call you.</p>

                <p>Users might not be able to read sections or see options to click on because they do not display correctly on their device.</p>
